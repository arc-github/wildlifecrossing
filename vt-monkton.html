  <h1>Monkton Wildlife Crossing</h1>

  <p>
    In an increasingly busy area outside Burlington, Vermont, what was once a dirt road is now a bustling thoroughfare. These higher traffic levels were putting local amphibians like salamanders, newts, and frogs, in danger of extirpation before the construction of two wildlife underpasses saved the future of these populations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thirty years ago, the two-lane Monkton-Vergennes road saw about 300 cars per day; today, it sees more than 1,600, with vehicles often traveling well above the 45 mile per hour speed limit. At that speed you can barely see – let alone stop – for salamanders and frogs migrating from one side of the road, where they winter in upland forest habitat, to the wetlands on the other side, where they breed in spring. Before the underpasses, more than 50% of these animals were meeting their end under the wheels of fast-moving vehicles.
  </p>

  <p>
    For 15 years, local stakeholders and concerned individuals gathered data on amphibian movement across the roadway to help determine where to site the crossings. While conducting the science to select the best sites, this ambitious group of public-private partners was also fundraising. In 2010, they successfully applied for a Federal Highway Administration Transportation Alternatives (TA) grant through the Vermont Agency of Transportation, along with a United States Fish and Wildlife State Wildlife Grant (SWG) through the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department.
  </p>

  <p>
    Coupled with matching private dollars, these TA and SWG funds were used to construct two concrete, box-style underpasses with a natural bottom, plus fencing. The culverts provide ambient light, airflow, and moisture to mimic the natural surroundings. The fencing design employs concrete blocks acting as a retaining wall that prevents amphibians from getting up onto the road, while directing them towards the culverts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since the project was completed in 2015, more than 2,000 amphibians have been documented—using time-lapse game cameras—crossing through the tunnels every year. In summer 2021, a University of Vermont graduate student studied the crossings to compare their effectiveness with untreated portions of the roadway.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because the culverts were designed large enough, other small- and medium-sized animals like bobcat, mink, ermine, porcupine, and eastern cottontail have also been documented using the tunnels.
  </p>

  <p>
    Getting these animals off the roadway makes the Monkton-Vergennes Road safer for people, too.
