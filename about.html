  <h1>Wonderful World of Wildlife Crossings</h1>

  <p>
Every 26 seconds–or less–a driver hits an animal, making highways one of the greatest barriers to wildlife movement in the United States. In addition to killing 1-2 million large animals every year, these collisions cause 200 human fatalities and more than 26,000 injuries, at a cost to Americans of more than $8 billion annually. Road mortality is also a serious threat to 21 endangered and threatened species.

The good news is there are proven solutions: Placed in areas of known wildlife movement, wildlife crossing structures with associated elements such as fencing, have been shown to reduce motorist collisions involving wildlife by up to 97%.

In celebration of how people from all walks of life are working together to solve this problem,  ARC Solutions  and  Wildlands Network  have developed this compilation of stories that celebrate existing and future wildlife crossing projects that make our highways safer for people and wildlife.  </p>

  <p>
    This site documents a growing number of case studies—from large-scale statewide connectivity assessments to highly localized structure-specific installations. Users can filter these examples by structure type, funding mechanism, target species, project status, and more.
  </p>

  <h2>Who This Platform Is For</h2>
  <p>
    This project is intended for transportation planners, ecologists, policymakers, researchers, and community advocates working to implement solutions that balance infrastructure with conservation. It is also a tool for public engagement and education.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Use This Site</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the map to explore wildlife crossings by location</li>
    <li>Filter projects based on species, funding source, or structural type</li>
    <li>Click on a project to read more about its history, goals, and outcomes</li>
  </ul>

 <h2>ARC Solutions </h2> 
      <ul>

      <li>ARC Solutions is an international network whose mission is to identify and promote leading-edge solutions to improve human safety, wildlife mobility and long-term landscape connectivity. We do this by fostering innovation in the placement, design and construction of wildlife crossings. We know these are solutions that work, and we seek to share this knowledge to build support for safe passage.   </ul>li>
    <li> ARC is a partnership network of nonprofit, private, public, academic, and philanthropic partners in the U.S. and Canada and is fiscally sponsored by  Social & Environmental Entrepreneurs  in Calabasas, California.
  </p>

  <p>
 Wildlands Network  works to protect core habitats and migration corridors for wildlife so that life—in all of its diversity—can thrive. This work is being furthered in California through advancing innovative statewide policies, promoting solutions through collaborative, diverse partnerships, and science-driven on-the-ground conservation and road ecology projects. 
 Wildlands Network is a 501(c)(3) organization headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.
