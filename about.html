  <h1>Wonderful World of Wildlife Crossings</h1>

  <p>
    The "Wonderful World of Wildlife Crossings" project is an interactive map-based platform designed to highlight and explore efforts to restore landscape connectivity for wildlife across North America. As roads and highways continue to fragment natural habitats, safe passage structures like overpasses and underpasses play a critical role in reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions and maintaining biodiversity.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site documents a growing number of case studiesâ€”from large-scale statewide connectivity assessments to highly localized structure-specific installations. Users can filter these examples by structure type, funding mechanism, target species, project status, and more.

  <h2>Why Wildlife Crossings Matter</h2>
  <p>
    Habitat fragmentation is one of the leading threats to species survival. Roads not only increase mortality from vehicle collisions, but also isolate populations, disrupt migration, and hinder access to resources. Wildlife crossings help reconnect these fragmented landscapes, supporting ecological processes and enhancing public safety.
  </p>

  <h2>Who This Platform Is For</h2>
  <p>
    This project is intended for transportation planners, ecologists, policymakers, researchers, and community advocates working to implement solutions that balance infrastructure with conservation. It is also a tool for public engagement and education.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Use This Site</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the map to explore wildlife crossings by location</li>
    <li>Filter projects based on species, funding source, or structural type</li>
    <li>Click on a project to read more about its history, goals, and outcomes</li>
  </ul>
